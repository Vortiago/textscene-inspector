# GraphEdit

GraphEdit is the scrollable, zoomable canvas for wiring GraphNodes together, with a
grid, connection lines, a toolbar and a minimap. The previewer parses and validates it
but does not draw it, so it renders as a transform-only fallback and its children still
show.

## Linting

<!-- lint:begin GraphEdit -->
Strict parsing format-checks these `GraphEdit` properties, plus 53 inherited from Control, 16 inherited from CanvasItem, 10 inherited from Node. A malformed value is always an **error**; a value that is merely outside a bound is an error only where Godot's setter refuses it, and a **warning** where only the property's inspector hint states the bound (ADR-0032).

| Property | Accepts | Out of range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `connection_lines_antialiased` | true or false |  |
| `connection_lines_curvature` | float |  |
| `connection_lines_thickness` | float 0-100 | error below, warning above |
| `connections` | Array literal ([...] or Array[Dictionary]([...])) |  |
| `grid_pattern` | enum 0-1 (GRID_PATTERN_LINES/GRID_PATTERN_DOTS) | warning |
| `minimap_enabled` | true or false |  |
| `minimap_opacity` | float |  |
| `minimap_size` | Vector2(x, y), or the Vector2i spelling Godot converts |  |
| `panning_scheme` | enum 0-1 (SCROLL_ZOOMS/SCROLL_PANS) | warning |
| `right_disconnects` | true or false |  |
| `scroll_offset` | Vector2(x, y), or the Vector2i spelling Godot converts |  |
| `show_arrange_button` | true or false |  |
| `show_grid` | true or false |  |
| `show_grid_buttons` | true or false |  |
| `show_menu` | true or false |  |
| `show_minimap_button` | true or false |  |
| `show_zoom_buttons` | true or false |  |
| `show_zoom_label` | true or false |  |
| `snapping_distance` | integer 2-100 | error |
| `snapping_enabled` | true or false |  |
| `type_names` | Dictionary literal ({…}) |  |
| `zoom` | float |  |
| `zoom_max` | float |  |
| `zoom_min` | float |  |
| `zoom_step` | float >= 0 | error below |

| Rule | Reports | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `binary-resource-reference` (all nodes) | `binary-resource-reference` | info |
| `valid-canvasitem-clip-ancestry` (type-family match) | `canvasitem-ancestor-clips-children` | warning |
|  | `canvasitem-ancestor-is-canvasgroup` | warning |
| `valid-control-tooltip-mouse-filter` (type-family match) | `control-tooltip-ignored-by-mouse-filter` | warning |
| `valid-graphedit-zoom-limits` | `graphedit-zoom-min-above-max` | error |
<!-- lint:end -->

The lenient parser is `parseControl`, which has no field for any of the twenty-five
GraphEdit members. A `snapping_distance = 500` that strict reports as an error reaches
the lenient tree as nothing at all.

## Known limitations

- **Not drawn** Godot draws the grid, connections, toolbar and minimap. The previewer
  draws nothing for this node.
